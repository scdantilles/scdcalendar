SCD Calendar
============

Google Calendar integration for the SCD

This module uses Google Calendar API and depends on gauth to query events like openning hours for each library or pole.

Each content of type Library have two fields:

 * field_google_account_name
 * field_calendar_id
 
that are used to query the events. This allows to have more than one google account to manage the calendars. But we use only one.

Some pages or blocks generated by this module will output two HTML blocks, one for mobile and one for desktop. It uses Bootstrap responsive helpers.
